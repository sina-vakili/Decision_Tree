# Decision_Tree

Explain how to do the calculations
  We have two kinds of dataset that includes a matrix of float numbers from 0 to about 1. in the other point of view. There is a label to find the best gain of the decision tree with these datasets. <br>
  The best way to find a better performance of them is by calculating entropy for each data set and then Comparison between the results.
